# AI Assistant Server

## Overview
The AI Assistant Server is a Node.js application that uses the Express.js framework and the OpenAI API to create an AI assistant. The server listens for POST requests at the '/ask' endpoint and responds with a message generated by the OpenAI API.

## Dependencies
- **express**: A web application framework for Node.js, used to create the server and handle HTTP requests.
- **openai**: The official OpenAI API client for JavaScript, used to interact with the OpenAI API.
- **cors**: A Node.js package for providing a Connect/Express middleware that can be used to enable CORS with various options.

## API Key
The OpenAI API key is hardcoded in the application. This is a security risk and should be replaced with a secure method of storing secrets.

## Server Setup
The server is set up to listen on port 3000 and uses the express.json() middleware for parsing incoming request bodies in JSON format. It also uses the cors() middleware to enable CORS.

## '/ask' Endpoint
This endpoint accepts POST requests. The request body should contain a 'prompt' property with the text that the AI should respond to. The endpoint interacts with the OpenAI API, sending a system message and a user message. The system message sets the context for the AI, and the user message contains the prompt from the request. The AI's response is then sent back in the HTTP response.

## OpenAI Model
The OpenAI model used is 'gpt-4-turbo-preview'. This is a preview version of the GPT-4 model and may not be available in the future.

## Server Start
The server starts listening on port 3000 and logs a message to the console when it's ready.

## Code
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const { OpenAI } = require('openai');
const cors = require('cors');

const openai = new OpenAI({ apiKey: 'Your API Key' });

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());
app.use(cors());

app.post('/ask', async (req, res) => {
  const prompt = req.body.prompt;
  const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    messages: [
      {
        role: 'system',
        content: 'You are a helpful assistant, SAM, for "SAP Assistant Master," reflecting the expertise and assistance I provide in SAP-related areas.  you are an expert in all areas of SAP ECC, SAP S/4 Hana, SAP BTP, SAP Solution Manager 7.2. and SAP Cloud ALM. You help users assess their business requirements and suggest solutions using standard SAP functionality or Fiori app development in SAP BTP.'
      },
      {
        role: 'user',
        content: prompt
      }
    ],
    model: 'gpt-4-turbo-preview',
  });

  res.send(response.choices[0].message.content);
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server listening on port 3000'));
